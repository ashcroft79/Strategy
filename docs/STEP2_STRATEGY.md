## Purpose & Philosophy

### What This Step Achieves

Step 2 transforms context into **coherent strategic architecture**. We move from "what's true" (Step 1) to "what we'll do about it" (Step 2).

### The Core Principles

#### 1. Coherence Through Connection
Every element connects vertically (up to purpose, down to action) and horizontally (to peers at same tier).

#### 2. Forced Choices
Strategy is saying NO. We force prioritization at every tier.

#### 3. Progressive Disclosure
Start simple, add depth as needed. Don't overwhelm with all tiers at once.

#### 4. Rationale Everywhere
Every entry requires "because..." - linking back to context and forward to impact.

### What Success Looks Like

At the end of Step 2, you should have:

- ✅ **Clear purpose**: Everyone knows WHY we exist
- ✅ **Strategic focus**: 3-5 drivers that organize our efforts
- ✅ **Bold intentions**: Aspirational statements of what success looks like
- ✅ **Concrete commitments**: Time-bound deliverables with owners
- ✅ **Complete traceability**: Red thread from vision to individual
- ✅ **Validated structure**: No orphans, balanced portfolio

#### Section 3: EXECUTION (Tiers 7-9)
**Answers**: What will we deliver? Who's doing what?  
**Changes**: Regularly (quarterly)  
**Participants**: Everyone

---

## Section 1: PURPOSE

### TIER 1: Vision / Mission / Belief / Passion

#### What They Are

**Four types of foundational statements** - organizations may have one, some, or all:

**VISION**: Aspirational future state
- Paints picture of world you want to create
- External focus (outcome, not capabilities)
- Inspirational, stretching

**MISSION**: What you do and for whom
- Concrete statement of purpose
- Specific about who you serve
- Actionable

**BELIEF**: Core conviction that drives you
- Debatable stance (not universal truth)
- Connects to actions and decisions
- Meaningful and specific

**PASSION**: What energizes you
- Emotional connection to work
- Source of motivation
- Optional but powerful

#### Guidance by Type

##### VISION Statements

**Good vision statements**:
- Paint a picture you can imagine
- Focus on outcome, not your organization
- Are aspirational but believable

**✅ Examples**:
- "A world where healthcare is accessible to all, regardless of location or income"
- "Every student graduates with skills and confidence to thrive"
- "Clean energy powers every home and business"

**❌ Avoid**:
- "Be the leading provider of innovative solutions" (vague, internal focus)
- "Maximize shareholder value" (purely financial, uninspiring)
- "Transform the industry" (generic, no picture)

**Prompts to craft vision**:
- If we're wildly successful in 10 years, what's different in the world?
- What problem do we exist to solve at scale?
- Close your eyes - what does success look like?

##### MISSION Statements

**Good mission statements**:
- Specific about who you serve
- Clear about what you do
- Concrete and actionable

**✅ Examples**:
- "We deliver telemedicine platforms that connect rural patients with specialist care"
- "We provide workforce training programs that help unemployed adults transition to tech careers"
- "We create educational content that makes complex science accessible to 12-16 year olds"

**❌ Avoid**:
- "We provide innovative solutions to customers" (who? what solutions?)
- "We exist to make a difference" (how? for whom?)
- "We deliver excellence in everything we do" (meaningless)

**Prompts to craft mission**:
- Complete this: "We exist to [verb] for [specific people] so that [outcome]"
- Who would miss us if we disappeared tomorrow? Why?
- What unique value do we create for specific stakeholders?

##### BELIEF Statements

**Good belief statements**:
- Are debatable (not universally accepted)
- Connect to actions and decisions
- Reveal what you stand for

**✅ Examples**:
- "Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege for the wealthy"
- "Remote work is the future, and offices are optional"
- "Transparency builds trust better than confidentiality"

**❌ Avoid**:
- "We believe in excellence and innovation" (everyone agrees)
- "Quality matters" (not debatable)
- "People are our greatest asset" (generic platitude)

**Prompts to craft belief**:
- What do we believe that others might disagree with?
- What stance would explain our strategy to outsiders?
- What conviction drives our decisions?

#### Rationale Requirement

Every Tier 1 statement must include:

```
STATEMENT: [The vision/mission/belief]

RATIONALE:
- Context connection: "Given [context from Step 1]..."
- Why this matters: "We believe this because..."
- How it guides us: "This means we will/won't..."
```

**Example**:
```
VISION: "Every child in rural communities has access to the same quality education as urban peers"

RATIONALE:
- Context: 40% of rural schools lack qualified STEM teachers, limiting student opportunities
- Why this matters: Education inequality perpetuates economic disparity for generations
- How it guides us: We'll prioritize solutions accessible without high-speed internet or expensive equipment
```

---

### TIER 2: Values

#### What Values Are

**Values** are the principles that guide behavior and decision-making. They describe what's important to your organization.

**Not**: Aspirations, strategies, or generic platitudes  
**But**: Principles you'll defend even when inconvenient

#### How Many Values?

**Recommended**: 4-6 values maximum

**Why limited?**
- More than 6 = meaningless (can't remember or apply)
- Fewer than 3 = incomplete picture

#### Structure of a Value

Each value includes:

1. **Name** (1-3 words): "Speed Over Perfection"
2. **Description** (2-3 sentences): What this means in practice
3. **Trade-off** (1 sentence): What we sacrifice for this value

#### Crafting Strong Values

**Good values**:
- Specific to your organization (not generic)
- Include trade-offs (what you give up)
- Guide difficult decisions

**✅ Examples**:

**"Speed Over Perfection"**
- Description: "We ship fast, learn fast, and iterate. A working prototype beats a perfect plan. We bias toward action."
- Trade-off: "We accept that first versions may be rough, and we'll need to refine based on feedback."

**"Transparent by Default"**
- Description: "We share information openly - financials, strategy, even mistakes. Transparency builds trust and enables smart decisions at all levels."
- Trade-off: "We sometimes share things that make us uncomfortable, and we risk information being misused."

**"Customer Obsessed"**
- Description: "We start with customer needs, not our solutions. Customer feedback overrides internal opinions. We measure success by customer outcomes."
- Trade-off: "We sometimes pursue things that are difficult or expensive if customers need them."

**❌ Avoid**:

- "Excellence" (without context - everyone values excellence)
- "Integrity" (without specifics - too vague)
- "Innovation" (without trade-offs - what don't you do to innovate?)

#### Values Prompts

To identify values, ask:
- What principles guide us in difficult decisions?
- What would we defend even if it's costly?
- What do we value that others might not?
- When have we made decisions that surprised others? What principle drove that?

#### Rationale for Values

```
VALUE: [Value name]

RATIONALE:
- Why this value: "Given our [purpose/context], this value matters because..."
- How it shows up: "You see this value when we..."
- What we sacrifice: "Living this value means we give up..."
```

---

### TIER 3: Behaviours

#### What Behaviours Are

**Behaviours** are observable actions that demonstrate values in practice.

**Formula**: "We [specific action that anyone can see]"

**Not**: "We value..." (that's a value, not a behavior)  
**Not**: "We strive to..." (that's an aspiration, not a behavior)

#### How Many Behaviours?

**Recommended**: 8-12 behaviors total (2-3 per value)

#### Structure of a Behaviour

Each behavior includes:

1. **Statement** (1 sentence): "We [observable action]"
2. **Linked Values** (1-3 values this demonstrates)
3. **Examples** (optional but helpful): Real scenarios where this behavior applies

#### Crafting Strong Behaviours

**Good behaviors**:
- Start with "We..." (collective commitment)
- Describe specific observable actions
- Are concrete enough to evaluate ("Did we do this?")

**✅ Examples**:

**"We share work-in-progress early and often, inviting feedback before perfecting"**
- Links to: Speed Over Perfection, Transparent by Default
- Example: Engineers demo half-finished features in weekly reviews

**"We challenge decisions in meetings, not hallways"**
- Links to: Transparent by Default, Customer Obsessed
- Example: If you disagree with a decision, you speak up in the moment

**"We say 'no' to good opportunities to say 'yes' to great ones"**
- Links to: Speed Over Perfection, Focus
- Example: We declined partnership opportunity because it didn't serve core customers

**❌ Avoid**:

- "We value collaboration" (that's a value, not behavior)
- "We strive for excellence" (aspiration, not observable)
- "We are innovative" (description, not action)
- "We work hard" (vague, not specific)

#### Behaviour Prompts

To identify behaviors, ask:
- How do our values show up in daily work?
- What do new employees notice about how we operate?
- What would a fly on the wall observe?
- When we're at our best, what are we doing?

#### Rationale for Behaviours

```
BEHAVIOUR: [The "We..." statement]

RATIONALE:
- Values connection: "This behavior demonstrates [value] because..."
- Why it matters: "This behavior helps us [outcome]"
- When we see it: "You'll observe this when..."
```

## Section 2: STRATEGIC CORE

### TIER 4: Strategic Drivers

#### What Strategic Drivers Are

**Strategic Drivers** are the 3-5 major focus areas or themes that organize your strategic efforts.

**Think of them as**: Organizing buckets, strategic pillars, or themes.

**Not**: Initiatives, projects, or departments (those come later)

#### The Forcing Function: 3-5 Maximum

**This is deliberate and non-negotiable.**

**Why limit to 3-5?**
- Forces hard prioritization
- Creates actual strategy (not a wish list)
- Enables focus and alignment
- Manageable for communication

**If you have 7-10 "drivers"**: You don't have a strategy, you have a to-do list.

#### Structure of a Strategic Driver

Each driver includes:

1. **Name** (1-3 words): Adjective + Noun or Adverb + Verb
2. **Description** (2-3 sentences): What this driver means
3. **Rationale** (2-3 sentences): Strategic choice - why this, why now
4. **Context Link** (explicit): Which opportunities/strengths does this capitalize on?

#### Naming Strategic Drivers

**Ideal structure**: Adjective + Noun
- "Customer Excellence"
- "Operational Resilience"
- "Digital Innovation"

**Alternative**: Adverb + Verb
- "Compete Differently"
- "Scale Globally"
- "Innovate Continuously"

**❌ Avoid**:
- Long phrases: "Customer Excellence Through Digital Innovation" (too long)
- Generic terms alone: "Growth", "Excellence", "Innovation" (need context)
- Department names: "Sales Strategy" (drivers cross departments)

#### Strategic Driver Examples

**✅ Good**:

**"Customer Intimacy"**
- Description: "We compete on deep understanding of customer needs and personalized service, not on price or product features."
- Rationale: "Market research shows NPS is #1 predictor of retention in our industry (75% correlation). We're betting on loyalty over acquisition."
- Context: Capitalizes on our strength (strong customer relationships) and opportunity (competitors focus on product, not service)

**"Geographic Expansion"**
- Description: "We grow revenue by entering adjacent geographic markets where our current product/service fits with minimal adaptation."
- Rationale: "Core market is mature (3% growth). Adjacent markets offer 15-20% growth with 60% lower customer acquisition costs than new product development."
- Context: Addresses opportunity (adjacent markets) with existing strength (proven product-market fit)

**❌ Avoid**:

- "Improve Customer Satisfaction" (that's an intent or metric, not a driver)
- "Sales and Marketing Excellence" (too broad, likely two separate drivers)
- "Digital Transformation" (vague buzzword without specifics)

#### The Hard Part: Choosing What's NOT a Driver

**Exercise: The "Not" List**

For every driver chosen, explicitly name what's NOT a driver:

```
OUR DRIVERS:
1. Customer Intimacy
2. Geographic Expansion
3. Operational Efficiency

WHAT WE'RE NOT FOCUSING ON:
- New product development (staying with current product)
- Competing on price (maintaining premium positioning)
- Vertical integration (partner, don't build)
```

This forces clarity about trade-offs.

#### Rationale for Strategic Drivers

```
DRIVER: [Name]

RATIONALE:
- Context connection: "Based on [opportunities/strengths from context]..."
- Strategic choice: "We're choosing to focus here instead of [alternative] because..."
- Success looks like: "We'll know this driver is working when..."
```

---

### TIER 5: Strategic Intents

#### What Strategic Intents Are

**Strategic Intents** are bold, aspirational statements of what success looks like for each driver.

**Think of them as**: The destination, the outcome, the picture of success  
**Not**: Commitments (those are time-bound and concrete - Tier 7)

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Bold**: Stretching, ambitious, aspirational
2. **Timeless**: No specific deadline (may take multiple horizons)
3. **Outcome-focused**: What success looks like, not how we'll get there
4. **Outside-in**: Customer/market perspective, not internal capabilities
5. **Imaginable**: Can picture what this looks like when achieved

#### How Many Intents?

**Recommended**: 2-3 intents per strategic driver

**Total**: 6-15 intents across all drivers

#### Structure of a Strategic Intent

Each intent includes:

1. **Statement** (1-2 sentences): Bold aspiration
2. **Driver Link** (required): Which driver does this serve?
3. **Rationale** (2-3 sentences): Why this intent for this driver?

#### Crafting Strong Strategic Intents

**Good intents**:
- Paint a picture of the end state
- Use outside-in perspective (customer/market voice)
- Are imaginable and specific
- Are bold without being impossible

**✅ Examples**:

**For Driver "Customer Intimacy":**

**"Our platform becomes the industry standard customers choose first"**
- Bold: Implies market leadership
- Timeless: No specific date
- Outcome: Industry standard position
- Outside-in: "Customers choose first"
- Imaginable: Can picture this reality

**"Customers describe us as 'anticipating what I need before I ask'"**
- Bold: Proactive, not reactive service
- Timeless: A way of being, not a milestone
- Outcome: Perceived anticipation
- Outside-in: Customer voice ("what I need")
- Imaginable: Can picture these testimonials

**For Driver "Operational Resilience":**

**"We maintain 99.99% uptime even during peak demand and major incidents"**
- Bold: Very high bar
- Timeless: Ongoing capability
- Outcome: Measurable reliability
- Outside-in: Customer experience focus
- Imaginable: Can picture the metrics

**❌ Avoid**:

- "Improve customer satisfaction scores" (metric, not intent; internal focus)
- "Build a world-class customer service team" (capability, not outcome)
- "Increase NPS to 75 by Q4" (that's a commitment, not an intent)
- "Enhance our customer experience" (vague, not imaginable)

#### Intents vs. Commitments

**Common confusion**: What's the difference?

| **Strategic Intent** | **Iconic Commitment** |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Timeless aspiration | Time-bound deliverable |
| Outcome focused | Action focused |
| "What success looks like" | "What we'll deliver" |
| May take years | Has target date |
| Painted picture | Concrete initiative |

**Example**:
- **Intent**: "Customers describe us as 'anticipating needs before they ask'"
- **Commitment (H1)**: "Launch predictive recommendations engine Q2"
- **Commitment (H2)**: "Implement proactive support triggers Q4"

The commitments deliver on the intent over time.

#### Rationale for Strategic Intents

```
INTENT: [Statement]

RATIONALE:
- Driver connection: "This intent serves [driver] by..."
- Why this matters: "Achieving this would mean..."
- How we'll know: "We'll see this when..."
```

---

### TIER 6: Enablers

#### What Enablers Are

**Enablers** are foundational capabilities, resources, or infrastructure that must exist for your strategy to work.

**Think of them as**: Load-bearing walls, critical infrastructure, non-negotiable foundations

**Not**: Nice-to-haves, wish lists, or every project

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Foundational**: Strategy can't work without them
2. **Cross-cutting**: Support multiple drivers/intents
3. **Non-negotiable**: Must have, not optional
4. **Capability-focused**: What we need to have/be

#### How Many Enablers?

**Recommended**: 4-8 total

**Warning**: If you have 15+ enablers, you're listing every project. Focus on critical foundations only.

#### Structure of an Enabler

Each enabler includes:

1. **Name** (2-5 words): The capability/resource
2. **Description** (2-3 sentences): What it is and why foundational
3. **Driver Links** (1-5 drivers): Which drivers depend on this?
4. **Type** (category): Technology, Process, People, Culture, Partnership
5. **Current State** (optional): Do we have this? Partially? Not at all?

#### Enabler Categories

**Technology/Systems**:
- Platforms, tools, infrastructure
- Example: "Real-time data platform", "Cloud infrastructure"

**Process**:
- Ways of working, methodologies
- Example: "Agile delivery model", "Customer feedback loops"

**People/Skills**:
- Capabilities, expertise, team composition
- Example: "Data science capability", "Change management expertise"

**Culture**:
- Organizational norms, mindsets
- Example: "Experimentation culture", "Customer-centric mindset"

**Partnerships**:
- Strategic relationships, ecosystem
- Example: "Strategic technology partnerships", "Distribution partners"

#### Crafting Strong Enablers

**Good enablers**:
- Support multiple parts of strategy (cross-cutting)
- Are clearly foundational (strategy fails without them)
- Have clear definition (know when we have it)

**✅ Examples**:

**"Real-Time Data Platform"**
- Description: "Unified data warehouse with real-time analytics capabilities, powering customer insights and operational dashboards across all systems."
- Drivers: Customer Intimacy (insights), Operational Resilience (monitoring), Geographic Expansion (scalable infrastructure)
- Type: Technology
- Current State: Partially (have data warehouse, but not real-time)

**"Customer Success Methodology"**
- Description: "Structured approach to customer onboarding, engagement, and growth with defined playbooks, metrics, and escalation paths."
- Drivers: Customer Intimacy (engagement), Geographic Expansion (scalable growth)
- Type: Process
- Current State: Not yet (ad-hoc currently)

**❌ Avoid**:

- "New website" (likely a commitment, not foundational enabler)
- "Marketing strategy" (that's strategy itself, not an enabler)
- Every project or initiative (be selective - what's truly foundational?)

#### Rationale for Enablers

```
ENABLER: [Name]

RATIONALE:
- Why foundational: "Without this, we cannot [achieve strategy] because..."
- Which drivers depend on it: "This enables [drivers] by..."
- Current gap: "We currently have/lack..."
```

---

## Section 3: EXECUTION

### TIER 7: Iconic Commitments

#### What Iconic Commitments Are

**Iconic Commitments** are concrete, time-bound deliverables with clear ownership that deliver on strategic intents.

**Think of them as**: Big visible moves, strategic initiatives, major bets  
**Not**: Business-as-usual work, ongoing operations

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Concrete**: Clear deliverable you can point to
2. **Time-bound**: Has target date and horizon (H1/H2/H3)
3. **Owned**: ONE person/team accountable
4. **Visible**: Big enough to matter, visible to organization
5. **Strategic**: Links to strategic intents
6. **Measurable**: Success criteria defined

#### Horizon Framework

Every iconic commitment must have a **time horizon**:

**H1 (0-12 months)**: Optimize & Deliver
- Near-term wins
- Building momentum
- Proven concepts

**H2 (1-2 years)**: Build & Scale
- Mid-term transformations
- Scaling what works
- Capabilities being built

**H3 (2-3 years)**: Explore & Create
- Long-term strategic bets
- Unproven concepts
- Future-focused experiments

#### Portfolio Balance

**Typical healthy distribution**:
- 50% H1 (momentum, deliverables)
- 30% H2 (building future)
- 20% H3 (exploring possibilities)

**Warning signs**:
- 80%+ H1 = short-term focus, no future building
- 0% H1 = no near-term momentum
- 70%+ H3 = unrealistic, not grounded

#### Structure of an Iconic Commitment

Each commitment includes:

1. **Name** (3-10 words): Clear description of what
2. **Description** (3-5 sentences): What will be delivered, success criteria
3. **Horizon** (required): H1, H2, or H3
4. **Primary Driver** (required): ONE driver that owns this
5. **Secondary Drivers** (optional): Other drivers this contributes to (1-2 max)
6. **Linked Intents** (required): Which strategic intents does this advance?
7. **Owner** (required): Person or team accountable
8. **Target Date** (required): Expected delivery
9. **Rationale** (required): Why this commitment, why now?

#### Primary vs Secondary Alignment

**This is the core innovation of the Strategic Pyramid approach.**

**Primary Driver** (required, singular):
- ONE driver that OWNS this commitment
- Primary accountability
- Where this counts in portfolio balance
- Who loses most if this fails

**Secondary Drivers** (optional, 0-2):
- Other drivers that benefit
- Secondary contributions
- Nice-to-haves, not primary purpose

**Why this matters**:
- Forces clarity of ownership
- Prevents "everything supports everything"
- Reveals real strategic bets
- Shows imbalanced portfolios

**Example**:

```
COMMITMENT: "Launch AI-powered customer insights dashboard"

Primary Driver: Customer Intimacy (85% of value)
  → This is fundamentally about understanding customers better
  → Customer Intimacy team owns delivery
  → Counts toward Customer Intimacy portfolio

Secondary Driver: Operational Resilience (15% of value)
  → Dashboard will also help operations team spot issues early
  → Nice benefit, but not primary purpose
```

#### Crafting Strong Iconic Commitments

**Good commitments**:
- Specific deliverable with clear end state
- Measurable success criteria
- Realistic within horizon
- Owned by single accountable party

**✅ Examples**:

**"Launch Mobile App 2.0 with Offline-First Architecture"**
- Description: "Complete redesign of mobile app with offline-first architecture, supporting 14-day operation without connectivity. Success = 95% feature parity with online mode, <100ms sync time, 4.5+ app store rating."
- Horizon: H2
- Primary Driver: Customer Intimacy
- Secondary: Operational Resilience (offline capability)
- Intents: Supports "Customers describe us as reliable anywhere"
- Owner: Sarah Chen (Product Lead)
- Target: Q3 2026
- Rationale: Rural customers cite connectivity as #1 pain point (40% of user base). Competitors don't offer offline mode.

**"Establish 24/7 Customer Support Center"**
- Description: "Build follow-the-sun support team across 3 time zones (US, EU, APAC) with tier 1/2 capability, <30min response time, multilingual. Success = 24/7 coverage, <5min average response time."
- Horizon: H1
- Primary Driver: Customer Intimacy
- Secondary: None
- Intents: Supports "Customers describe us as always there"
- Owner: Marcus Johnson (Support Lead)
- Target: Q2 2026
- Rationale: Losing enterprise deals due to lack of 24/7 support (3 deals, $2M ARR). Urgent competitive gap.

**❌ Avoid**:

- "Improve customer satisfaction" (not concrete)
- "Digital transformation initiative" (vague)
- "Ongoing operations" (not strategic initiative)
- "Explore AI possibilities" (no deliverable)

#### Linking to Strategic Intents

**Every commitment must link to at least one strategic intent.**

This creates traceability:
```
Vision
  ↓
Strategic Driver
  ↓
Strategic Intent ← "What success looks like"
  ↓
Iconic Commitment ← "What we'll deliver to get there"
```

**Orphaned commitments** (not linked to any intent) are red flags - they may not be strategic.

#### Rationale for Iconic Commitments

```
COMMITMENT: [Name]

RATIONALE:
- Strategic alignment: "This delivers on [intent] which serves [driver]"
- Why now: "We're prioritizing this in [horizon] because..."
- Success criteria: "We'll know this succeeded when..."
- Primary ownership: "[Driver] owns this because..."
```

### TIER 8: Team/Collective Objectives

#### What Team Objectives Are

**Team Objectives** are goals that functional or cross-functional teams commit to in support of iconic commitments.

**Think of them as**: Team-level contributions, collective accountabilities  
**Not**: Individual work, business-as-usual operations

#### Structure of a Team Objective

Each team objective includes:

1. **Name** (3-8 words): What the team will achieve
2. **Description** (2-3 sentences): What will be delivered
3. **Team** (required): Which team owns this
4. **Linked Commitment** (required): Which iconic commitment does this support?
5. **Metrics** (optional but recommended): How success is measured
6. **Owner** (required): Team lead accountable

#### Crafting Team Objectives

**Good team objectives**:
- Clear line of sight to iconic commitment
- Team-level scope (not individual tasks)
- Measurable outcome
- Realistic for team capacity

**✅ Example**:

```
Iconic Commitment: "Launch Mobile App 2.0 with Offline Mode"
  ↓
Team Objective (Backend Engineering): "Complete Offline Sync API"
  - Description: "Build API that enables offline data storage and background sync with conflict resolution, supporting 14-day offline operation."
  - Team: Backend Engineering
  - Metrics: API response time <100ms, 99.9% sync success rate
  - Owner: Alex Rivera (Backend Lead)
```

### TIER 9: Individual Objectives/Contributions

#### What Individual Objectives Are

**Individual Objectives** are personal goals that connect individual work to team objectives and ultimately to strategy.

**Think of them as**: Personal contributions, individual accountabilities  
**Not**: Job descriptions, performance reviews

#### Structure of an Individual Objective

Each individual objective includes:

1. **Name** (3-8 words): What this person will deliver
2. **Description** (1-2 sentences): What specifically
3. **Individual** (required): Person's name
4. **Linked Team Objectives** (required): Which team objectives does this support?
5. **Success Criteria** (optional): How achievement is measured

#### Crafting Individual Objectives

**Good individual objectives**:
- Link to team objectives
- Appropriate scope for individual
- Include stretch/development
- Achievable with reasonable effort

**✅ Example**:

```
Team Objective: "Complete Offline Sync API"
  ↓
Individual Objective (Jamie): "Implement Conflict Resolution Algorithm"
  - Description: "Design and implement last-write-wins conflict resolution with automatic merge for non-overlapping changes."
  - Individual: Jamie Chen
  - Success: Unit tests pass, handles 99%+ of conflicts automatically
```

## Red Thread Methodology

### What is the Red Thread?

The **red thread** is the causal connection from vision all the way to individual actions.

**It answers**: "Why am I doing this work?"

```
Vision: "Healthcare accessible to all"
  ↓ why?
Driver: "Geographic Expansion"
  ↓ what does success look like?
Intent: "Rural communities have same access as urban"
  ↓ what will we deliver?
Commitment: "Launch telemedicine platform"
  ↓ what must the team do?
Team Objective: "Build HIPAA-compliant video infrastructure"
  ↓ what's my part?
Individual: "Implement end-to-end encryption"
```

Every person can trace their work back to vision.

### Red Thread Validation

**Questions to ask**:
- Can I draw a line from any individual objective to vision?
- Are there orphaned items (no parent)?
- Are there gaps (nothing delivering on an intent)?

**Tool support**:
- Visual traceability maps
- Orphan detection
- Coverage analysis

## Horizon Planning

### The 3 Horizons Model

**H1 (0-12 months)**: Optimize & Deliver
- **Focus**: Execute on known opportunities
- **Risk**: Low to moderate
- **Investment**: Maintain and improve
- **Examples**: Iterative improvements, proven features, operational excellence

**H2 (1-2 years)**: Build & Scale
- **Focus**: Build new capabilities and scale
- **Risk**: Moderate
- **Investment**: Build for future
- **Examples**: New products, market expansion, capability building

**H3 (2-3 years)**: Explore & Create
- **Focus**: Explore and experiment
- **Risk**: High
- **Investment**: Strategic bets
- **Examples**: Moonshots, unproven concepts, future positioning

### Portfolio Balance

**Check your distribution**:
- Total commitments by horizon
- Distribution per driver
- Overall balance

**Warning signs**:
- All H1 = No future building
- All H3 = Unrealistic, no momentum
- One driver all H1, another all H3 = Imbalanced strategic bets

### Sequencing and Dependencies

**H3 → H2 → H1 Flow**:
- H3 experiments that prove out graduate to H2
- H2 capabilities that mature move to H1
- H1 delivery funds H2 and H3 investment

**Example**:
- H3: "Explore AI for customer support" (experiment)
- H2: "Build AI support assistant" (proven, now scaling)
- H1: "Optimize AI response accuracy" (mature, now improving)

## Validation & Coherence

### Validation Checks (8 Core Checks)

The tool provides automated validation. Here's what it checks:

#### 1. Completeness
- All required tiers populated
- Minimum items per tier met
- No empty sections

#### 2. Structure
- All relationships valid (IDs exist)
- No circular dependencies
- Primary driver is singular

#### 3. Orphaned Items
- Intents without drivers
- Commitments without intents
- Team objectives without commitments

#### 4. Balance
- Portfolio distribution across drivers
- Horizon balance (H1/H2/H3)
- Driver concentration

#### 5. Language Quality
- Jargon detection
- Specificity check
- Boldness assessment

#### 6. Commitment Quality
- Has owner
- Has target date
- Description detailed enough

#### 7. Horizon Realism
- Not all H1
- Not zero H1
- Balanced distribution

#### 8. Alignment Strength
- Primary driver assigned
- Secondary drivers reasonable (not excessive)

### Manual Coherence Check

**Questions to ask**:

1. **Does context inform purpose?**
   - Do vision/values connect to opportunities/strengths?
   
2. **Do drivers align to purpose?**
   - Do strategic drivers serve the vision?

3. **Do intents stretch appropriately?**
   - Are they bold enough to inspire?
   - But believable enough to pursue?

4. **Do commitments deliver intents?**
   - Will these commitments actually advance intents?
   - Or are they disconnected activity?

5. **Is ownership clear?**
   - One person/team owns each commitment?
   - No shared accountability?

6. **Is the portfolio balanced?**
   - Drivers have reasonable commitment distribution?
   - Horizons appropriately balanced?

## Workshop Facilitation

### Recommended Timeline (Standard)

**Week 1: PURPOSE**
- Session 1 (2 hours): Vision/Mission/Belief
- Session 2 (2 hours): Values and Behaviours

**Week 2: STRATEGIC CORE**
- Session 3 (3 hours): Strategic Drivers
- Session 4 (3 hours): Strategic Intents & Enablers

**Week 3: EXECUTION**
- Session 5 (3 hours): Iconic Commitments (H1/H2/H3)
- Session 6 (2 hours): Primary/Secondary Alignment

**Week 4: REFINEMENT**
- Session 7 (2 hours): Team Objectives
- Session 8 (2 hours): Validation & Polish

### Facilitation Tips

**Building Purpose (Week 1)**:
- Start with "why" - reconnect to context
- Draft vision individually first, then converge
- Values emerge from real decisions, not brainstorming
- Behaviours come from "when we're at our best"

**Defining Strategic Core (Week 2)**:
- Drivers are the hard part - force the 3-5 limit
- Write "not" list for each driver
- Intents should inspire - push for boldness
- Enablers are foundational, not wish lists

**Planning Execution (Week 3)**:
- Commitments should excite people
- Force primary driver choice (hardest conversation)
- Balance portfolio visibly (show distribution)
- Reality-check horizons (capacity constraints)

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: "We Have 8 Strategic Drivers"

**Symptom**: Can't narrow to 3-5 drivers

**Root cause**: Avoiding hard choices, fear of saying no

**Solution**:
- Force ranking: Which 3 matter MOST?
- Resource constraint: "You only have budget for 3"
- CEO choice: "If you had to pick 3, which ones?"

### Challenge 2: "Everything Links to Every Driver"

**Symptom**: Commitments have 4-5 secondary drivers

**Root cause**: Avoiding primary ownership

**Solution**:
- Ask: "Who loses MOST if this fails?"
- That's your primary driver
- Others are secondary (if truly relevant)

### Challenge 3: "All Our Commitments Are H1"

**Symptom**: 80%+ commitments in near term

**Root cause**: Short-term pressure, lack of strategic thinking

**Solution**:
- Show imbalance visually
- Ask: "What happens in 18 months?"
- Force some H2/H3 commitments

### Challenge 4: "Our Intents Sound Like Commitments"

**Symptom**: Intents have dates, are too concrete

**Root cause**: Confusion between aspiration and action

**Solution**:
- Show examples of good intents
- Remove dates from intents
- Ask: "What's the picture of success?" (not "what will we do")
