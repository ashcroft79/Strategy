## Purpose & Philosophy

### The Problem This Step Solves

**The "Drawer Deck" Syndrome:**

```
Month 1:  Beautiful strategy created, leadership excited
Month 3:  Strategy deck shared, some confusion
Month 6:  Context has changed, strategy hasn't
Month 9:  Teams doing different things, misalignment growing
Month 12: "Let's create a new strategy" (repeat cycle)
```

**Step 3 prevents this by making strategy a living practice, not a static document.**

### Core Principles

#### 1. Strategy is a Verb, Not a Noun
Strategy isn't something you HAVE (a document).  
Strategy is something you DO (a continuous practice).

#### 2. Learning Informs Adaptation
Execute → Learn → Adjust → Execute (continuous loop)

This is borrowed from:
- Agile/Scrum: Inspect and adapt
- Lean Startup: Build-Measure-Learn
- OODA Loop: Observe-Orient-Decide-Act

#### 3. Transparency Creates Alignment
Everyone sees:
- Current progress
- What's changing and why
- How their work connects to impact

#### 4. Context Changes, Strategy Evolves
External realities shift, new information emerges.  
Strategy must adapt or become obsolete.

### What Success Looks Like

After establishing Step 3 rhythms:

✅ **Real-time visibility**: Everyone knows current progress  
✅ **Regular learning**: Insights captured and shared  
✅ **Evidence-based adaptation**: Changes driven by data, not opinions  
✅ **Reduced friction**: Constraints removed proactively  
✅ **Continuous alignment**: Strategy stays relevant to reality  
✅ **Momentum sustained**: Progress feels meaningful

## Why Most Strategies Die

### The Six Failure Patterns

#### 1. "Set It and Forget It"
**What happens**: Strategy created, then filed away  
**Why it fails**: No mechanism to keep it alive  
**Result**: Business as usual resumes within weeks

#### 2. "Context Shifts, Strategy Doesn't"
**What happens**: Market changes, competitors move, regulations shift  
**Why it fails**: No regular context refresh  
**Result**: Strategy becomes obsolete but unchanged

#### 3. "No Line of Sight"
**What happens**: Front-line teams don't see connection to strategy  
**Why it fails**: Poor cascade, vague commitments  
**Result**: Teams do what seems logical locally, misalignment grows

#### 4. "Execution Without Learning"
**What happens**: Teams execute but don't capture learnings  
**Why it fails**: No retrospectives, insights lost  
**Result**: Repeat mistakes, miss opportunities

#### 5. "Everything is Top Priority"
**What happens**: All commitments marked urgent, no sequencing  
**Why it fails**: No real prioritization or trade-offs  
**Result**: Burnout, nothing finishes, quality suffers

#### 6. "Communication Vacuum"
**What happens**: Leadership knows progress, no one else does  
**Why it fails**: Updates not shared broadly  
**Result**: Rumors, speculation, loss of trust

### What Step 3 Provides

A system to prevent all six failure patterns:

| **Failure Pattern** | **Step 3 Solution** |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Set & Forget | Regular review cadences |
| Context unchanged | Quarterly context refresh |
| No line of sight | Red thread visibility, cascade clarity |
| No learning | Learning reviews built-in |
| No prioritization | Horizon framework, capacity constraints |
| Communication vacuum | Regular updates, transparent dashboard |

## The Living Strategy System

### Overview: The Four Cadences

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The four cadences work together as an integrated system:

1. **MONITOR**: What's happening? (Continuous)
2. **LEARN**: What does it mean? (Regular)
3. **ADJUST**: What changes? (Periodic)
4. **COMMUNICATE**: Who needs to know? (Ongoing)

---

## The Four Cadences

### Cadence 1: MONITOR (Continuous)

**Purpose**: Real-time awareness of progress, context shifts, and blockers

**Frequency**: Continuous (dashboards) + Weekly (team check-ins)

#### What We Monitor

**1. Context Shifts**
- Market changes
- Competitive moves
- Regulatory updates
- Customer sentiment
- Technology trends

**Questions**:
- Are our SOCC assumptions still valid?
- What's different from when we created strategy?
- What new information have we learned?

**2. Progress Metrics**
- Commitment status (on track / at risk / blocked)
- Milestone completion
- Team objective progress
- Leading indicators

**Questions**:
- Are we making progress toward intents?
- Which commitments are on track? Behind?
- Where are we blocked?

**3. Constraint Evolution**
- New blockers emerging
- Existing constraints worsening/improving
- Resource constraints tightening/loosening

**Questions**:
- What new constraints have appeared?
- Are known constraints being addressed?
- What's slowing us down?

**4. Emerging Opportunities**
- Unexpected learnings
- New possibilities
- Quick wins

**Questions**:
- What are we learning that surprises us?
- What new opportunities have emerged?
- What's working better than expected?

#### Monitoring Mechanisms

**Digital Dashboard** (Real-time)
- Commitment status by horizon
- Progress toward intents
- Key metrics (leading/lagging)
- Blockers logged and tracked
- Recent context changes

**Weekly Team Check-Ins** (15-30 minutes)
- Progress pulse: Green / Yellow / Red
- Blockers identified
- Help needed
- Wins celebrated

**Monthly Health Reviews** (1 hour)
- Deeper dive on metrics
- Trend analysis
- Early warning signals
- Cross-team dependencies

#### Dashboard Design Principles

1. **Visual**: Use color, charts, trends (not just tables)
2. **Hierarchical**: High-level view with drill-down
3. **Real-time**: Update automatically, not manually
4. **Accessible**: Everyone can see relevant parts
5. **Actionable**: Clear next steps when things are off track

---

### Cadence 2: LEARN (Regular Rhythm)

**Purpose**: Make sense of what we're observing, capture insights, update assumptions

**Frequency**: 
- Sprint/iteration retrospectives (2 weeks - 1 month)
- Monthly learning reviews (team level)
- After-action reviews (post-commitment completion)

#### What We Learn About

**1. What's Working** (Double Down)
- Which approaches are effective?
- What's exceeding expectations?
- Where should we accelerate?

**2. What's Not Working** (Pivot or Kill)
- What's underperforming?
- What assumptions were wrong?
- What should we stop doing?

**3. What Surprised Us** (Update Assumptions)
- What didn't we anticipate?
- What proved easier/harder than expected?
- What changed our thinking?

**4. What's Missing** (Fill Gaps)
- What gaps exist in our strategy?
- What did we overlook?
- What new needs have emerged?

#### Learning Review Formats

**Sprint/Iteration Retrospective** (30-60 minutes)
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- What will we try differently?
- What did we learn about our customers/market?

**Monthly Learning Review** (1-2 hours)
- Progress review (what shipped, what didn't)
- Deep dive on 1-2 learnings
- Validated learning documentation
- Insights that inform strategy

**After-Action Review** (60-90 minutes)
After completing an iconic commitment:
- What was the outcome?
- What was expected vs. actual?
- What did we learn?
- What would we do differently?
- How does this inform other commitments?

#### Capturing Learnings

**Learning Log Template**:
```
DATE: _________
CONTEXT: What were we doing?
OBSERVATION: What did we notice?
HYPOTHESIS: Why did this happen?
EVIDENCE: What supports this?
IMPLICATION: What does this mean for strategy?
ACTION: What should we do differently?
```

**Example Learning**:
```
DATE: February 15, 2026
CONTEXT: Launched AI recommendations feature (H1 commitment)
OBSERVATION: 60% of users disabled feature within first week
HYPOTHESIS: Recommendations felt intrusive, not helpful
EVIDENCE: User feedback, session recordings, support tickets
IMPLICATION: "Anticipate customer needs" intent may require more transparency/control
ACTION: Pivot to opt-in recommendations with explanation of why shown
```

#### Learning Outcomes

Each learning review should produce:
- ✅ **Validated learnings**: What we now know to be true
- ✅ **Updated assumptions**: What changed from original thinking
- ✅ **New insights**: What we discovered that's valuable
- ✅ **Recommended actions**: What should change in strategy/execution

---

### Cadence 3: ADJUST (Periodic)

**Purpose**: Make evidence-based changes to strategy and execution based on learnings

**Frequency**:
- Quarterly strategy refresh (mandatory)
- Ad-hoc as needed for major context shifts

#### What We Adjust

**High Frequency (Quarterly)**:
- Tier 7: Iconic Commitments (add/remove/modify)
- Tier 8-9: Team & Individual Objectives (rebalance)
- Portfolio balance (H1/H2/H3 shifts)
- Resource allocation

**Low Frequency (Annually or as needed)**:
- Tier 4: Strategic Drivers (rarely change, but validate)
- Tier 5: Strategic Intents (refine if needed)
- Tier 6: Enablers (add new if critical)
- Tier 1-3: Purpose (very rarely - fundamental changes only)

**Never change lightly**:
- Vision/Mission (should be multi-year stable)
- Values (only with major cultural shift)

#### The Adjustment Decision Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  EVIDENCE THRESHOLD                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                     │
│  Minor Adjustment (Execution)                       │
│  Evidence: 1-2 data points, team consensus         │
│  Examples: Adjust commitment scope, shift H2→H1    │
│                                                     │
│  Moderate Adjustment (Tactics)                      │
│  Evidence: Multiple data points, external validation│
│  Examples: Add new commitment, rebalance portfolio  │
│                                                     │
│  Major Adjustment (Strategic Core)                  │
│  Evidence: Strong pattern, contradicts assumptions  │
│  Examples: Modify strategic intent, add driver      │
│                                                     │
│  Fundamental Change (Purpose)                       │
│  Evidence: Existential change, market transformation│
│  Examples: Pivot vision, redefine mission          │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rule of thumb**: 
- Adjust execution (Tiers 7-9) liberally based on learning
- Adjust strategic core (Tiers 4-6) cautiously based on strong patterns
- Adjust purpose (Tiers 1-3) rarely based on fundamental shifts

#### Quarterly Adjustment Process

**Week 1: Review & Reflect**
- Review last quarter learnings
- Analyze metrics and trends
- Gather team input
- Identify what needs adjustment

**Week 2: Propose Changes**
- Draft proposed adjustments
- Rationale for each change
- Impact analysis
- Socialize with stakeholders

**Week 3: Decide & Communicate**
- Leadership reviews proposals
- Decisions made with rationale
- Changes documented
- Broadly communicated

**Week 4: Implement**
- Update pyramid
- Revise objectives
- Reallocate resources
- Kick off new quarter

#### Adjustment Log

Every adjustment should be logged:

```
ADJUSTMENT LOG ENTRY

Date: _________
Tier Affected: _________
Type: Add / Modify / Remove
What Changed: _________
Rationale: Why this change?
Evidence: What data/learning drove this?
Impact: What else is affected?
Approved By: _________
```

This creates an **evolution history** showing how strategy adapted over time.

## Adaptation Protocols

### When to Adjust Different Tiers

| **Tier** | **Frequency** | **Trigger** | **Approval** |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1-3 (Purpose) | Rare (years) | Fundamental shift | CEO + Board |
| 4 (Drivers) | Rarely (1-2 years) | Strategic pivot | Leadership team |
| 5 (Intents) | Annually | Intent achieved or invalidated | Leadership team |
| 6 (Enablers) | As needed | Critical gap identified | Leadership team |
| 7 (Commitments) | Quarterly | Progress review | Driver owners |
| 8 (Team Objectives) | Quarterly | Commitment changes | Team leads |
| 9 (Individual) | Quarterly | Team objective changes | Managers |

### Adjustment Best Practices

**1. Require Evidence**
- Not opinions or gut feel
- Data, learnings, validated assumptions
- Multiple sources when possible

**2. Document Rationale**
- Why this change?
- What evidence supports it?
- What's the expected impact?

**3. Communicate Broadly**
- Don't surprise people with changes
- Explain the "why" behind adjustments
- Give time to absorb before implementing

**4. Monitor Impact**
- Did the adjustment have desired effect?
- What second-order consequences emerged?
- Learn from the adjustment itself

## Constraint Removal

### Why This Matters

**Constraints slow everything down.**

From Amy Gibson's research (Image #1): "They Remove Barriers - Clearing obstacles people name creates space for genuine forward progress."

### Active Constraint Management

#### 1. Identify & Log Constraints

**Constraint Log Template**:
```
CONSTRAINT: [What's blocking us?]
IMPACT: Who/what does this affect?
SEVERITY: ⬜ Low  ⬜ Medium  ⬜ High
DURATION: How long has this been blocked?
OWNER: Who can remove this?
STATUS: ⬜ Open  ⬜ In Progress  ⬜ Resolved
```

#### 2. Triage & Prioritize

**Prioritization Matrix**:
```
                High Impact
                     │
     Urgent &        │    Important but
     Critical        │    Not Urgent
                     │
─────────────────────┼─────────────────────
                     │
     Not Blocking    │    Low Priority
     Actively        │    / Nice to Have
                     │
                Low Impact
```

#### 3. Assign Removal Owners

**Not** the people being blocked - they can't remove it.  
**But** the people with authority to remove it.

**Examples**:
- Budget constraints → CFO or budget owner
- Technical debt → Tech lead / CTO
- Process bottlenecks → Process owner
- Skill gaps → HR / L&D leader

#### 4. Track Time to Resolution

**Metric**: Average days from logged to resolved

**Target**: Define acceptable timeframes by severity
- Critical: <7 days
- High: <30 days
- Medium: <90 days

#### 5. Celebrate Unblocking

**Make constraint removal visible**:
- Celebrate in team meetings
- Track removal velocity
- Recognize leaders who remove blockers

### Constraint Removal Meetings

**Bi-weekly "Blocker Bash"** (30-60 minutes):
- Review open constraints
- Status updates from owners
- Escalate stuck items
- Assign new constraints
- Celebrate resolved ones

**Attendees**: 
- Leadership (decision authority)
- Driver owners
- Anyone reporting blocks

## Governance Structure

### Who Decides What?

| **Decision** | **Who Decides** | **Input From** | **Frequency** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Purpose changes | CEO + Board | Leadership + Broad org | Rare |
| Driver additions/changes | Leadership Team | All stakeholders | Annual |
| Intent refinements | Leadership Team | Driver owners | Annual |
| New commitments | Leadership Team | Driver owners | Quarterly |
| Commitment modifications | Driver owners | Team leads | Quarterly |
| Resource reallocation | Leadership Team | Driver owners | Quarterly |
| Portfolio rebalancing | Leadership Team | Driver owners | Quarterly |
| Team objectives | Team leads | Team members | Quarterly |
| Individual objectives | Managers | Individuals | Quarterly |
| Constraint removal | Accountable leader | Anyone | Ongoing |

### Decision-Making Principles

#### 1. Right Level, Right Speed
- Execution decisions at team level (fast)
- Strategic decisions at leadership level (thoughtful)
- Purpose decisions at CEO/Board level (rare)

#### 2. Transparent Decision-Making
- Decisions documented with rationale
- Input solicited before major decisions
- Outcomes communicated broadly

#### 3. Reversible vs. Irreversible
- **Reversible decisions** (most execution): Move fast, adjust if wrong
- **Irreversible decisions** (strategic core): Move thoughtfully, gather evidence

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: "We're Too Busy Executing to Review"

**Symptom**: Skip retrospectives, learning reviews  
**Result**: Repeat mistakes, miss learnings  
**Solution**: Make reviews non-negotiable, timebox them

### Pitfall 2: "Our Metrics Are All Lagging"

**Symptom**: Only measure outcomes, no leading indicators  
**Result**: Learn problems too late to adjust  
**Solution**: Add leading indicators that predict outcomes

### Pitfall 3: "We Adjust Based on Loudest Voice"

**Symptom**: Changes driven by opinions, not evidence  
**Result**: Strategy whiplash, loss of focus  
**Solution**: Require evidence threshold for adjustments

### Pitfall 4: "Strategy Updates Are Top-Down Only"

**Symptom**: Leadership tells, teams don't contribute  
**Result**: Valuable insights missed, disengagement  
**Solution**: Two-way communication, solicit input

### Pitfall 5: "We Never Remove Commitments"

**Symptom**: Only add new commitments, never remove  
**Result**: Overload, nothing finishes well  
**Solution**: Kill/defer lower-priority items when adding new ones

### Pitfall 6: "Dashboard is a Vanity Metric Showcase"

**Symptom**: Only positive metrics shown  
**Result**: False confidence, blind spots  
**Solution**: Show truth - progress AND problems

### Success Indicators for Step 3

After 3-6 months, you should see:

✅ **Participation**: Teams actively engaging in reviews  
✅ **Learning velocity**: Regular insights captured  
✅ **Adaptation speed**: Changes based on evidence  
✅ **Transparency**: Everyone knows current state  
✅ **Constraint removal**: Blockers being resolved  
✅ **Alignment**: Teams can explain how work connects to strategy

## Conclusion

**Step 3 is what separates dead documents from living strategies.**

Most organizations do Steps 1-2 well (context + plan).  
Few organizations do Step 3 at all (execution + adaptation).

The result? Strategies that become obsolete, teams that lose connection to purpose, and a cycle of creating "new" strategies every year.

**Step 3 changes that.**

By building monitoring, learning, adjustment, and communication into ongoing practice, strategy becomes a **living system** that:
- Stays relevant to reality
- Adapts based on evidence
- Maintains alignment across the organization
- Creates sustained momentum

---

**Ready to implement?**

Start with:
1. Define your key metrics
2. Schedule your first monthly review
3. Build a simple dashboard
4. Commit to the quarterly rhythm

Then refine based on what you learn.
