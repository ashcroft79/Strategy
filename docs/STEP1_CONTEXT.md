## Purpose & Philosophy

### The Core Principle

**Strategy without context is hope, not strategy.**

Before you can decide where to go, you must understand where you are. Before you can choose what to do, you must understand what's true.

Step 1 is about building **shared reality** - ensuring everyone sees the same picture and understands the same constraints and opportunities.

### What We're NOT Doing

❌ **Not SWOT**: While similar, SOCC is more nuanced  
❌ **Not exhaustive analysis**: Paralysis by analysis helps no one  
❌ **Not past-focused**: We care about history only as it informs future  
❌ **Not once-and-done**: Context changes, we revisit regularly  

### What We ARE Doing

✅ **Building shared understanding**: Everyone sees same reality  
✅ **Surfacing tensions**: Making hard choices visible  
✅ **Prioritizing opportunities**: Not all opportunities are equal  
✅ **Creating strategic rationale**: Why this strategy, why now?

## Why Context Matters

### The Consequences of Skipping Context

**Real example patterns we've seen:**

#### Pattern 1: "The Vision Without Market"
- **What happened**: Leadership created inspiring vision based on belief
- **Reality**: No market demand, no customer need identified
- **Result**: Beautiful strategy, zero traction, wasted resources

#### Pattern 2: "The Strategy Ignoring Constraints"
- **What happened**: Ambitious 12-month commitments defined
- **Reality**: Team at 80% capacity, no budget for new hires
- **Result**: Burnout, missed deadlines, loss of credibility

#### Pattern 3: "The Opportunity We Can't Deliver"
- **What happened**: Exciting market opportunity identified
- **Reality**: No technical capability, 2+ years to build
- **Result**: Competitor seized opportunity, we arrived too late

### The Power of Starting with Context

When you start with context:

1. **Grounded Vision**: Vision connects to real needs/opportunities
2. **Realistic Planning**: Constraints inform what's actually possible
3. **Faster Execution**: Fewer surprises, less rework
4. **Better Decisions**: Trade-offs based on reality, not opinions
5. **Team Alignment**: Shared understanding prevents misalignment

### Context as "Tier 0"

In the Strategic Pyramid, context sits as **Tier 0** - the foundation beneath the pyramid itself.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TIER 0: CONTEXT                             │
│ • Strengths, Opportunities                  │
│ • Considerations, Constraints               │
│ • Stakeholder Landscape                     │
│ • Strategic Tensions                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓ informs
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TIER 1-9: THE PYRAMID                       │
│ Everything above is grounded in context     │

## The SOCC Framework

### Overview

**SOCC** = Strengths, Opportunities, Considerations, Constraints

This is our innovation on traditional SWOT analysis, designed to be more actionable and interconnected.

### The Four Quadrants

```
┌──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│  STRENGTHS               │  OPPORTUNITIES           │
│  (Internal, Positive)    │  (External, Positive)    │
│                          │                          │
│  What we're good at      │  What needs exist        │
│  What assets we have     │  What's changing         │
│  What's working          │  Where is white space    │
│                          │                          │
│  → AMPLIFIERS            │  → FOCUS AREAS           │
├──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│  CONSIDERATIONS          │  CONSTRAINTS             │
│  (Mixed, Threats)        │  (Internal, Blockers)    │
│                          │                          │
│  What's working against  │  What's stopping us      │
│  External threats        │  Resource limitations    │
│  Weakening areas         │  "Yes, but..." factors   │
│                          │                          │
│  → TURBULENCE            │  → CIRCUMVENTION         │
└──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

### Detailed Definitions

#### STRENGTHS (Internal Amplifiers)

**What they are**: Internal capabilities, assets, or attributes that give you advantage

**Questions to ask**:
- What are we really good at?
- What unique assets do we have?
- What's working well that we should build on?
- What do stakeholders value about us?
- What capabilities differentiate us?

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Strong brand reputation in target market"
- ✓ "Technical team with rare expertise in X"
- ✓ "Existing distribution network in 30 countries"
- ✓ "Culture of innovation and experimentation"
- ✓ "Deep customer relationships built over 10 years"

**What to avoid**:
- ✗ Generic claims ("We're innovative")
- ✗ Aspirations ("We want to be best-in-class")
- ✗ Things you used to have but don't anymore

#### OPPORTUNITIES (External Possibilities)

**What they are**: External conditions, needs, or trends you could capitalize on

**Questions to ask**:
- What problems exist that we could solve?
- What market needs are unmet or underserved?
- What trends are moving in our favor?
- Where is there white space to explore?
- What changes create new possibilities?

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Growing demand for remote work tools (40% CAGR)"
- ✓ "Regulatory change opening new market segment"
- ✓ "Competitor exit creating available customers"
- ✓ "Technology advancement enabling new solutions"
- ✓ "Cultural shift toward sustainability"

**What to avoid**:
- ✗ Internal projects ("Opportunity to improve our processes")
- ✗ Vague trends ("The future is digital")
- ✗ Opportunities you can't actually pursue

#### CONSIDERATIONS (External Turbulence)

**What they are**: External threats, competitive pressures, or weakening positions

**Questions to ask**:
- What external forces work against us?
- What competitive threats exist?
- What are we becoming less good at?
- What market conditions are deteriorating?
- Where are we losing ground?

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Competitor launched cheaper alternative with 60% of features"
- ✓ "Customer retention declining from 85% to 78%"
- ✓ "Economic downturn reducing customer budgets"
- ✓ "Brand perception weakening in key demographic"
- ✓ "Regulatory pressure increasing compliance costs"

**What to avoid**:
- ✗ Internal weaknesses (those are constraints)
- ✗ Unchangeable facts ("Competition exists")
- ✗ Everything as a threat (prioritize real ones)

#### CONSTRAINTS (Internal Blockers)

**What they are**: Internal limitations, blockers, or "yes, but..." factors

**Questions to ask**:
- What's stopping us from moving faster?
- What resources are limited or missing?
- What capabilities do we lack?
- What organizational barriers exist?
- What are the "yes, but..." factors?

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Technical debt slowing development by 30%"
- ✓ "No budget for additional headcount"
- ✓ "Legacy systems incompatible with modern tools"
- ✓ "Siloed organization preventing collaboration"
- ✓ "Key skills gap in data science"

**What to avoid**:
- ✗ External factors (those are considerations)
- ✗ Excuses without ownership
- ✗ Permanent impossibilities

### How the Quadrants Interact

The power of SOCC comes from **connecting the quadrants**:

```
OPPORTUNITY: "Enter adjacent market segment"
    ↑ amplified by
STRENGTH: "Strong brand reputation"
    ↓ complicated by
CONSIDERATION: "Established competitors"
    ↓ blocked by
CONSTRAINT: "Limited sales capacity"

→ INSIGHT: High potential but requires sales team expansion
→ DECISION: Pursue in H2 after sales team build in H1
```

This interconnection reveals:
- Which opportunities are most viable (strong amplifiers, weak blockers)
- Which opportunities are risky (weak amplifiers, strong blockers)
- What must change to unlock opportunities (address constraints)

### PESTLE Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Focus on forces that actually impact your strategy
- ✅ Look 2-3 years ahead (not just current state)
- ✅ Consider both opportunities and threats
- ✅ Validate with external data/research where possible
- ✅ Update periodically (annually or when major shifts occur)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Try to be exhaustive (you'll drown in data)
- ❌ Treat all factors as equally important
- ❌ Ignore factors just because they're uncomfortable
- ❌ Do PESTLE in isolation from SOCC
- ❌ Forget to translate insights into actionable strategy

---

## PESTLE Analysis (Optional)

### What is PESTLE?

**PESTLE** is a systematic framework for scanning the macro-environment across six dimensions:
- **P**olitical
- **E**conomic
- **S**ocial
- **T**echnological
- **L**egal
- **E**nvironmental

### When to Use PESTLE

**Use PESTLE when:**
- Developing enterprise or business unit strategy
- Operating in regulated industries
- Expanding to new markets/geographies
- Long-term strategic planning (3-5+ years)
- Context is complex with many external forces

**Skip PESTLE when:**
- Team-level strategy (too macro)
- Fast-moving tactical planning
- Context is already well-understood
- Resources/time limited

### How PESTLE Feeds SOCC

PESTLE is a **scanning tool** that feeds into your SOCC analysis:

```
PESTLE Analysis
    ↓
Identifies external factors
    ↓
Sorted into SOCC:
├─ Opportunities (positive external trends)
├─ Considerations (threats, challenges)
└─ Context for Strengths (what external factors amplify our strengths?)
```

**Example Flow:**
- PESTLE identifies: "Government introducing tax credits for green tech"
- SOCC captures as: **Opportunity** - "Tax incentives reducing customer adoption costs"
- Later becomes: **Strategic Driver** - "Accelerate Green Technology Adoption"

- **Celebrate progress**: Acknowledge milestones

#### Handling Difficult Dynamics

**"Everything is a strength"** (toxic positivity)
- Response: "That's great. Now let's talk about what's not working. Every organization has constraints - what are ours?"

**"Everything is a constraint"** (learned helplessness)
- Response: "I hear the challenges. What's one thing that IS working? Let's start there."

**"This is all subjective"** (analysis paralysis)
- Response: "You're right, some is subjective. But we can validate with data. For now, let's capture what we believe to be true based on our experience."

**"We already know this"** (dismissiveness)
- Response: "Great. Then we should move quickly. Let's make sure we're all seeing the same picture."

## Opportunity Scoring

### The Scoring Formula

```
OPPORTUNITY SCORE = (Strength Match × 2) - Consideration Risk - Constraint Impact

Where:
- Strength Match: How well our strengths support this (1-5)
- Consideration Risk: How much considerations threaten this (1-5)
- Constraint Impact: How much constraints block this (1-5)

Score Range: -8 to +8
```

### Score Interpretation

| **Score** | **Interpretation** | **Recommendation** |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 7-10 | **High-confidence opportunity** | Prioritize, pursue soon |
| 4-6 | **Moderate opportunity** | Pursue with risk mitigation |
| 1-3 | **Marginal opportunity** | Requires significant changes first |
| 0 or below | **Low-viability opportunity** | Defer or decline |

### Scoring Examples

#### Example 1: "Launch AI-powered customer support tool"

**Strength Match (4/5)**:
- ✓ Strong technical team
- ✓ Existing customer base to test with
- ✓ Brand known for innovation
- ✗ Limited AI experience (reduces from 5 to 4)

**Consideration Risk (2/5)**:
- Low risk: Competitors not yet offering this
- Medium: Customer willingness to adopt AI uncertain

**Constraint Impact (3/5)**:
- Medium: Budget available but limited
- Medium: Would require hiring AI specialists
- Low: Tech infrastructure can support

**Score**: (4 × 2) - 2 - 3 = **3** (Marginal - proceed cautiously, address constraints first)

#### Example 2: "Expand into existing adjacent market"

**Strength Match (5/5)**:
- ✓ Product already solves this market's needs
- ✓ Sales team has relationships in adjacent space
- ✓ Brand recognition exists

**Consideration Risk (3/5)**:
- Medium: Some competitive presence
- Medium: Regulatory differences exist

**Constraint Impact (1/5)**:
- Low: Minimal additional resources needed
- Low: Sales team has capacity

**Score**: (5 × 2) - 3 - 1 = **6** (Moderate-to-High - strong candidate for H1/H2)

### Scoring Workshop Process

1. **Select opportunities to score** (usually top 10-15)
2. **Individual scoring** (5 minutes per opportunity)
3. **Share scores** (calculate average)
4. **Discuss outliers** (Why did some score high/low?)
5. **Adjust and finalize** (consensus scores)
6. **Rank by score** (creates prioritized list)

## Strategic Tensions

### What Are Strategic Tensions?

**Strategic tensions** are competing goods or conflicting priorities that require deliberate choices.

They're not problems to solve - they're **tensions to manage**.

### Common Strategic Tensions

#### 1. Growth vs. Profitability
- **Tension**: Invest in growth or optimize for profit?
- **Not**: Do both equally (impossible)
- **Choice**: What's the right balance for our stage?

#### 2. Innovation vs. Execution
- **Tension**: Explore new ideas or deliver on commitments?
- **Not**: Do both perfectly (spreads too thin)
- **Choice**: What ratio makes sense now?

#### 3. Speed vs. Quality
- **Tension**: Ship fast and iterate or perfect before launch?
- **Not**: Fast AND perfect (rarely possible)
- **Choice**: Where on spectrum for this initiative?

#### 4. Customer Breadth vs. Depth
- **Tension**: Serve many customer types or specialize?
- **Not**: Be all things to all people
- **Choice**: Who do we serve exceptionally well?

#### 5. Centralization vs. Autonomy
- **Tension**: Central control or local empowerment?
- **Not**: Both everywhere (creates confusion)
- **Choice**: What decisions stay central, what's distributed?

### How to Surface Tensions

**Questions to ask:**
- Where do we feel pulled in opposite directions?
- What trade-offs keep coming up?
- Where do different leaders disagree on priorities?
- What choices make us uncomfortable?

**Exercise: Tension Mapping**

```
Opportunity: "Expand product line"

Tension A: Breadth vs. Depth
├─ Left: Focus on 1-2 products (deep)
└─ Right: Launch many products (broad)

Tension B: Speed vs. Quality
├─ Left: Launch quickly, iterate (speed)
└─ Right: Perfect before launch (quality)

Where are we now? Where should we be?
    ←─────┼─────→
         Current    Target
```

### Why Name Tensions Explicitly

1. **Normalizes difficulty**: "This is supposed to be hard"
2. **Prevents false consensus**: Different people have different defaults
3. **Enables smart trade-offs**: Conscious choices, not accidents
4. **Creates space for experimentation**: We can try different positions

---

## Stakeholder Landscape

### Why Map Stakeholders?

Strategy doesn't exist in vacuum - it affects and is affected by stakeholders.

**Stakeholder landscape** understanding requires three levels:

1. **WHO matters** - Stakeholder mapping (influence/interest)
2. **WHAT they think/feel** - Empathy mapping (deeper understanding)
3. **WHO specifically** - Persona creation (archetypal segments)

This three-level approach ensures you:
- ✅ Identify all key stakeholders
- ✅ Understand their needs deeply
- ✅ Create targeted, relevant strategies
- ✅ Avoid generic "customer" or "employee" thinking

### Level 1: Stakeholder Mapping

**Purpose**: Identify who matters and how to engage them

#### Stakeholder Categories

#### Internal Stakeholders
- Leadership team
- Board of directors
- Employees (by function/level)
- Internal partners (shared services, etc.)

#### External Stakeholders
- Customers (by segment)
- Partners and suppliers
- Investors/shareholders
- Regulators
- Community
- Competitors (yes, they matter)

### Stakeholder Mapping Process

#### Step 1: Identify Stakeholders

**Prompt**: "Who has a stake in our success or failure?"

Create comprehensive list (aim for 15-25 stakeholder groups).

#### Step 2: Map by Influence and Interest

```
                    High Interest
                         │
        Keep Satisfied   │   Key Players
                         │
    ─────────────────────┼─────────────────────
                         │
           Monitor       │   Keep Informed
                         │
                    Low Interest
        
        Low Influence ←──┼──→ High Influence
```

**Quadrants:**
- **Key Players**: High interest, high influence → Engage closely
- **Keep Satisfied**: Low interest, high influence → Don't alienate
- **Keep Informed**: High interest, low influence → Communicate regularly
- **Monitor**: Low interest, low influence → Minimal effort

#### Step 3: Understand Needs

For each key stakeholder group:
- **What do they need from us?**
- **What do they value most?**
- **What are their concerns?**
- **How aligned are they?**

#### Step 4: Identify Actions

What do we need to do to:
- Build support from key players?
- Address concerns?
- Maintain important relationships?
- Prevent blockers?

### Stakeholder Analysis Template

```
STAKEHOLDER: [Name/Group]

Interest Level: ⬜ Low  ⬜ Medium  ⬜ High
Influence Level: ⬜ Low  ⬜ Medium  ⬜ High

Key Needs:
- [What they need from us]

Current Alignment: ⬜ Opposed  ⬜ Neutral  ⬜ Supportive

Concerns/Objections:
- [What worries them]

Actions Required:
- [What we need to do]
```

## Empathy Mapping

### What Empathy Mapping Is

**Empathy mapping** is a collaborative tool to gain deeper understanding of stakeholders by exploring what they **think, feel, say, and do**.

**Purpose**: Go beyond demographics and surface-level needs to understand the human experience of your key stakeholders.

### When to Use Empathy Maps

**Use empathy maps for:**
- Key customer segments (understand their world)
- Critical employee groups (understand their experience)
- Important partners (understand their perspective)
- Any stakeholder where deep understanding drives strategy

**Typically create**: 3-8 empathy maps for most important stakeholder groups

### The Empathy Map Canvas

### The Four Quadrants + Pains/Gains

#### THINK (What occupies their mind?)

**Questions to explore:**
- What keeps them awake at night?
- What are their worries and aspirations?
- What preoccupies their thoughts?
- What are they constantly thinking about?
- What questions do they ask themselves?

**Example (Healthcare Administrator):**
- "How do I reduce costs without compromising care?"
- "Will this technology actually work?"
- "What if staff resist this change?"
- "How do I prove ROI to the board?"

#### FEEL (What emotions do they experience?)

**Questions to explore:**
- What makes them happy or frustrated?
- What are their fears and anxieties?
- What excites or worries them?
- How do they feel about their situation?
- What emotional highs and lows do they experience?

**Example (Healthcare Administrator):**
- Overwhelmed by competing priorities
- Anxious about falling behind competitors
- Frustrated by slow bureaucracy
- Excited about innovation potential
- Fearful of making wrong technology bets

#### SAY (What do they communicate publicly?)

**Questions to explore:**
- What do they say in meetings?
- What's their public stance?
- How do they describe their challenges?
- What phrases do they use repeatedly?
- What do they post on social media/LinkedIn?

**Example (Healthcare Administrator):**
- "We need to do more with less"
- "Patient experience is our top priority"
- "We're committed to innovation"
- "Data security is non-negotiable"
- "We need solutions that work with existing systems"

#### DO (What actions do they take?)

**Questions to explore:**
- What's their daily routine?
- What tasks consume their time?
- How do they research and make decisions?
- What do they actually do (vs. say)?
- Where do they spend their time and money?

**Example (Healthcare Administrator):**
- Attends 6-8 hours of meetings daily
- Reviews financial reports weekly
- Benchmarks against peer institutions
- Pilots new technologies cautiously
- Delays decisions until consensus

#### PAINS (What frustrates them?)

**Questions to explore:**
- What obstacles do they face?
- What's preventing success?
- What creates friction or frustration?
- What risks worry them?
- What costs concern them?

**Example (Healthcare Administrator):**
- IT systems don't talk to each other
- Change initiatives fail due to staff resistance
- Board expects fast results with limited budget
- Compliance requirements constantly changing
- Vendor solutions overpromise and underdeliver

#### GAINS (What do they hope to achieve?)

**Questions to explore:**
- What does success look like?
- What would make their life easier?
- What outcomes do they desire?
- What would delight them?
- What would they consider a win?

**Example (Healthcare Administrator):**
- Improve patient outcomes measurably
- Reduce operational costs by 15%
- Become known as innovative leader
- Staff adoption without resistance
- Solutions that work out-of-the-box

### Empathy Mapping Process

**Duration**: 45-60 minutes per stakeholder group

**Step 1: Select Stakeholder Segment (5 min)**
- Choose specific stakeholder group to map
- Name them specifically (not just "customers")
- Example: "Rural hospital administrators, 100-300 beds"

**Step 2: Populate Quadrants (25 min)**
- Divide into pairs/small groups
- Each group takes 1-2 quadrants
- Capture observations, quotes, behaviors
- Use real data where available (interviews, research, observations)

**Step 3: Share & Synthesize (15 min)**
- Share insights across groups
- Look for patterns and themes
- Identify surprising insights
- Highlight contradictions (say vs. do)

**Step 4: Identify Pains & Gains (10 min)**
- Synthesize pains from frustrations/obstacles
- Synthesize gains from desires/hopes
- Prioritize top 3-5 of each

**Step 5: Strategic Implications (5 min)**
- How does this inform our strategy?
- What opportunities does this reveal?
- What must we address?
- What assumptions did we validate/invalidate?

### Creating Quality Empathy Maps

**Good empathy maps are:**
- ✅ Based on real data (interviews, research, observation)
- ✅ Specific and concrete (real quotes, specific behaviors)
- ✅ Reveal tensions (contradictions between say/do)
- ✅ Show patterns (themes across multiple people)
- ✅ Honest about negatives (pains, frustrations)

**Poor empathy maps are:**
- ❌ Based solely on assumptions/guesses
- ❌ Generic and vague ("they want good service")
- ❌ Overly positive (no real pains identified)
- ❌ Lack specificity (no concrete examples)
- ❌ Not validated with real stakeholders

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: "Analysis Paralysis"

**What it looks like**:
- Wanting more data before deciding
- Endless debate about details
- Delaying strategy work to "finish" context

**Why it happens**:
- Fear of being wrong
- Perfectionism
- Avoiding hard choices

**Solution**:
- Timeboxing: "We have 2 weeks, then we move forward"
- Good enough: "80% confidence is sufficient"
- Provisional: "We'll validate as we execute"

### Pitfall 2: "Toxic Positivity"

**What it looks like**:
- Everything is a strength
- No real constraints acknowledged
- Dismissing concerns as "negativity"

**Why it happens**:
- Culture that punishes truth-telling
- Leadership that doesn't want bad news
- Fear of being seen as negative

**Solution**:
- Frame it as "obstacles to remove"
- Show examples: "Great organizations acknowledge constraints"
- Anonymous input channels

### Pitfall 3: "Learned Helplessness"

**What it looks like**:
- Everything is a constraint
- No opportunities visible
- "We've tried everything"

**Why it happens**:
- History of failed initiatives
- Burnout and exhaustion
- Loss of agency

**Solution**:
- Start with strengths: "What IS working?"
- Small wins: "What could we do in next 30 days?"
- External perspective: Bring in outside facilitator

### Pitfall 4: "The Usual Suspects"

**What it looks like**:
- Same context from last year
- No new insights
- Recycled analysis

**Why it happens**:
- Going through motions
- No new information gathered
- Didn't involve diverse perspectives

**Solution**:
- Fresh voices: Include people new to organization
- Customer input: What are customers actually saying?
- Data: What does data show that surprises us?

### Pitfall 5: "Context as Checkbox"

**What it looks like**:
- Rushing through context to get to "real work"
- Perfunctory SWOT slide
- Moving to strategy without synthesis

**Why it happens**:
- Undervaluing context phase
- Pressure to show progress
- Impatience with groundwork

**Solution**:
- Show value: "This saved us 3 months of wasted effort last time"
- Make it engaging: Use interactive workshops, not slide reviews
- Explicit output: Context document that guides all future decisions

## Persona Creation

### What Personas Are

**Personas** are fictional but realistic representations of your key stakeholder segments based on research and data.

**Purpose**: Create shared understanding of WHO you're serving so strategy can be targeted and specific, not generic.

**Origin**: Borrowed from Design Thinking and Value Proposition Canvas (Strategyzer) methodology.

### Why Personas Matter for Strategy

**The problem personas solve**:
- "Customers" or "employees" are too vague
- Different people have different needs
- Generic strategies satisfy no one well
- Teams make assumptions instead of decisions

**What personas enable**:
- ✅ Specific, targeted strategies
- ✅ Shared mental model across teams
- ✅ Trade-off decisions ("This is for Sarah, not for John")
- ✅ Measurable validation (survey the persona segment)

### When to Create Personas

**Create personas for:**
- **Customer segments**: Who are we serving?
- **Employee segments**: Who are we hiring/developing?
- **Partner segments**: Who are we partnering with?
- **Any segment** critical to strategy success

**Typically create**: 3-5 personas (primary + secondary segments)

**Balance**: Enough to represent diversity, few enough to remember and use

### Persona Components

#### 1. Demographics & Background
- Name (fictional but memorable)
- Age, location, background
- Role/title/responsibilities
- Experience level
- Relevant characteristics

#### 2. Goals & Motivations
- What are they trying to achieve?
- What drives them?
- What success looks like to them?
- What metrics matter to them?

#### 3. Challenges & Pain Points
- What obstacles do they face?
- What frustrates them?
- What's hard in their world?
- What keeps them up at night?

#### 4. Behaviors & Preferences
- How do they make decisions?
- Where do they get information?
- What tools/channels do they use?
- What's their typical day like?

#### 5. Attitudes & Values
- What do they believe?
- What do they care about?
- What influences them?
- What do they prioritize?

#### 6. Needs & Desired Outcomes
- What do they need to be successful?
- What would delight them?
- What outcomes do they seek?
- What would make their life better?

### Creating Personas: The Process

**Step 1: Gather Data (Before Workshop)**
- Customer/stakeholder interviews
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Usage data and analytics
- Sales/support conversations
- Empathy maps (from previous section)

**Step 2: Identify Segments (Workshop - 30 min)**
- What distinct groups exist?
- How are they different from each other?
- Which segments matter most to strategy?
- Aim for 3-5 key segments

**Step 3: Build Personas (Workshop - 60 min per persona)**
- Work in small groups, one persona per group
- Use template to structure
- Draw from real data/quotes
- Make them feel real (name, background, quote)
- Identify what makes this segment unique

**Step 4: Share & Validate (Workshop - 30 min)**
- Present personas to full group
- Discuss: Does this feel accurate?
- Identify overlaps or gaps
- Prioritize: Primary vs. secondary segments

**Step 5: Test & Refine (Post-Workshop)**
- Validate with real stakeholders
- "Does this describe you?"
- Refine based on feedback
- Update with new learnings

### Persona Quality Checklist

**Good personas are:**
- ✅ Based on real data and research
- ✅ Specific and concrete (named, detailed)
- ✅ Representative of actual segment
- ✅ Distinct from each other
- ✅ Memorable and usable
- ✅ Include motivations AND frustrations
- ✅ Connected to business metrics (segment size, value)

**Poor personas are:**
- ❌ Made up without data
- ❌ Generic stereotypes
- ❌ All positive (no challenges mentioned)
- ❌ Too similar to each other
- ❌ So detailed no one remembers them
- ❌ Created once and never updated

### Using Personas in Strategy

**Throughout the pyramid:**

**Tier 1 (Vision/Mission):**
- Does our vision resonate with key personas?
- Are we solving problems they care about?

**Tier 4 (Strategic Drivers):**
- Which drivers serve which personas?
- Are we over-serving one persona, under-serving another?

**Tier 5 (Strategic Intents):**
- Use persona language in intents
- "Sarah can deploy in <30 days without dev team"

**Tier 7 (Iconic Commitments):**
- Is this commitment for Sarah or Michael?
- What would delight this persona?
- What pain does this solve for them?

**Design & Development:**
- "Would Sarah find this useful?"
- "Could Michael's staff actually use this?"
- Makes trade-off decisions clear

### Persona Validation

**How to validate personas:**

1. **Show to real people in segment**
   - "Does this describe you?"
   - "What's missing or wrong?"

2. **Test with team**
   - Can sales team recognize personas in prospects?
   - Does support hear these pains?

3. **Track in data**
   - Do usage patterns match persona behaviors?
   - Do survey responses align with persona needs?

4. **Update quarterly**
   - What have we learned?
   - How have personas evolved?
   - Do we need new personas?

                            │
                    Low Strategic Value
        
        Low Fit with        │        High Fit with
        Capabilities        │        Capabilities
```

**Prioritization questions:**
