## Purpose & Philosophy

### The Core Principle

**Strategy without context is hope, not strategy.**

Before you can decide where to go, you must understand where you are. Before you can choose what to do, you must understand what's true.

Step 1 is about building **shared reality** - ensuring everyone sees the same picture and understands the same constraints and opportunities.

### What We're NOT Doing

❌ **Not SWOT**: While similar, SOCC is more nuanced  
❌ **Not exhaustive analysis**: Paralysis by analysis helps no one  
❌ **Not past-focused**: We care about history only as it informs future  
❌ **Not once-and-done**: Context changes, we revisit regularly  

### What We ARE Doing

✅ **Building shared understanding**: Everyone sees same reality  
✅ **Surfacing tensions**: Making hard choices visible  
✅ **Prioritizing opportunities**: Not all opportunities are equal  
✅ **Creating strategic rationale**: Why this strategy, why now?

## Why Context Matters

### The Consequences of Skipping Context

**Real example patterns we've seen:**

#### Pattern 1: "The Vision Without Market"
- **What happened**: Leadership created inspiring vision based on belief
- **Reality**: No market demand, no customer need identified
- **Result**: Beautiful strategy, zero traction, wasted resources

#### Pattern 2: "The Strategy Ignoring Constraints"
- **What happened**: Ambitious 12-month commitments defined
- **Reality**: Team at 80% capacity, no budget for new hires
- **Result**: Burnout, missed deadlines, loss of credibility

#### Pattern 3: "The Opportunity We Can't Deliver"
- **What happened**: Exciting market opportunity identified
- **Reality**: No technical capability, 2+ years to build
- **Result**: Competitor seized opportunity, we arrived too late

### The Power of Starting with Context

When you start with context:

1. **Grounded Vision**: Vision connects to real needs/opportunities
2. **Realistic Planning**: Constraints inform what's actually possible
3. **Faster Execution**: Fewer surprises, less rework
4. **Better Decisions**: Trade-offs based on reality, not opinions
5. **Team Alignment**: Shared understanding prevents misalignment

### Context as "Tier 0"

In the Strategic Pyramid, context sits as **Tier 0** - the foundation beneath the pyramid itself.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TIER 0: CONTEXT                             │
│ • Strengths, Opportunities                  │
│ • Considerations, Constraints               │
│ • Stakeholder Landscape                     │
│ • Strategic Tensions                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓ informs
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TIER 1-9: THE PYRAMID                       │
│ Everything above is grounded in context     │

## The SOCC Framework

### Overview

**SOCC** = Strengths, Opportunities, Considerations, Constraints

This is our innovation on traditional SWOT analysis, designed to be more actionable and interconnected.

### The Four Quadrants

```
┌──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│  STRENGTHS               │  OPPORTUNITIES           │
│  (Internal, Positive)    │  (External, Positive)    │
│                          │                          │
│  What we're good at      │  What needs exist        │
│  What assets we have     │  What's changing         │
│  What's working          │  Where is white space    │
│                          │                          │
│  → AMPLIFIERS            │  → FOCUS AREAS           │
├──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┤
│  CONSIDERATIONS          │  CONSTRAINTS             │
│  (Mixed, Threats)        │  (Internal, Blockers)    │
│                          │                          │
│  What's working against  │  What's stopping us      │
│  External threats        │  Resource limitations    │
│  Weakening areas         │  "Yes, but..." factors   │
│                          │                          │
│  → TURBULENCE            │  → CIRCUMVENTION         │
└──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

### Detailed Definitions

#### STRENGTHS (Internal Amplifiers)

**What they are**: Internal capabilities, assets, or attributes that give you advantage

**Questions to ask**:
- What are we really good at?
- What unique assets do we have?
- What's working well that we should build on?
- What do stakeholders value about us?
- What capabilities differentiate us?

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Strong brand reputation in target market"
- ✓ "Technical team with rare expertise in X"
- ✓ "Existing distribution network in 30 countries"
- ✓ "Culture of innovation and experimentation"
- ✓ "Deep customer relationships built over 10 years"

**What to avoid**:
- ✗ Generic claims ("We're innovative")
- ✗ Aspirations ("We want to be best-in-class")
- ✗ Things you used to have but don't anymore

#### OPPORTUNITIES (External Possibilities)

**What they are**: External conditions, needs, or trends you could capitalize on

**Questions to ask**:
- What problems exist that we could solve?
- What market needs are unmet or underserved?
- What trends are moving in our favor?
- Where is there white space to explore?
- What changes create new possibilities?

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Growing demand for remote work tools (40% CAGR)"
- ✓ "Regulatory change opening new market segment"
- ✓ "Competitor exit creating available customers"
- ✓ "Technology advancement enabling new solutions"
- ✓ "Cultural shift toward sustainability"

**What to avoid**:
- ✗ Internal projects ("Opportunity to improve our processes")
- ✗ Vague trends ("The future is digital")
- ✗ Opportunities you can't actually pursue

#### CONSIDERATIONS (External Turbulence)

**What they are**: External threats, competitive pressures, or weakening positions

**Questions to ask**:
- What external forces work against us?
- What competitive threats exist?
- What are we becoming less good at?
- What market conditions are deteriorating?
- Where are we losing ground?

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Competitor launched cheaper alternative with 60% of features"
- ✓ "Customer retention declining from 85% to 78%"
- ✓ "Economic downturn reducing customer budgets"
- ✓ "Brand perception weakening in key demographic"
- ✓ "Regulatory pressure increasing compliance costs"

**What to avoid**:
- ✗ Internal weaknesses (those are constraints)
- ✗ Unchangeable facts ("Competition exists")
- ✗ Everything as a threat (prioritize real ones)

#### CONSTRAINTS (Internal Blockers)

**What they are**: Internal limitations, blockers, or "yes, but..." factors

**Questions to ask**:
- What's stopping us from moving faster?
- What resources are limited or missing?
- What capabilities do we lack?
- What organizational barriers exist?
- What are the "yes, but..." factors?

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Technical debt slowing development by 30%"
- ✓ "No budget for additional headcount"
- ✓ "Legacy systems incompatible with modern tools"
- ✓ "Siloed organization preventing collaboration"
- ✓ "Key skills gap in data science"

**What to avoid**:
- ✗ External factors (those are considerations)
- ✗ Excuses without ownership
- ✗ Permanent impossibilities

### How the Quadrants Interact

The power of SOCC comes from **connecting the quadrants**:

```
OPPORTUNITY: "Enter adjacent market segment"
    ↑ amplified by
STRENGTH: "Strong brand reputation"
    ↓ complicated by
CONSIDERATION: "Established competitors"
    ↓ blocked by
CONSTRAINT: "Limited sales capacity"

→ INSIGHT: High potential but requires sales team expansion
→ DECISION: Pursue in H2 after sales team build in H1
```

This interconnection reveals:
- Which opportunities are most viable (strong amplifiers, weak blockers)
- Which opportunities are risky (weak amplifiers, strong blockers)
- What must change to unlock opportunities (address constraints)

- Each person shares 2-3 items per quadrant
- Facilitator captures on board
- No debate yet, just capture

**1.3 Clarification (20 min)**
- Ask clarifying questions only
- "Tell me more about..."
- "What do you mean by..."

**1.4 Additional Items (20 min)**
- Inspired by others, add more items
- Fill gaps identified
- Challenge assumptions gently

#### Phase 2: Converge (60 minutes)

**2.1 Clustering (20 min)**
- Group similar items
- Name clusters
- Identify patterns

**2.2 Prioritization (20 min)**
- Vote on most important in each quadrant (5 votes per person)

### Facilitation Tips

#### Creating Safety
- **Normalize disagreement**: "Different perspectives are valuable"
- **Separate person from idea**: Ideas are critiqued, not people
- **Equal voice**: Ensure quieter voices are heard
- **Suspend judgment**: Diverge before converging

#### Managing Energy
- **Take breaks**: 10 min every 60-90 minutes
- **Mix methods**: Alternate individual/group, sitting/standing
- **Use timers**: Keeps pace, prevents endless discussion
- **Celebrate progress**: Acknowledge milestones

#### Handling Difficult Dynamics

**"Everything is a strength"** (toxic positivity)
- Response: "That's great. Now let's talk about what's not working. Every organization has constraints - what are ours?"

**"Everything is a constraint"** (learned helplessness)
- Response: "I hear the challenges. What's one thing that IS working? Let's start there."

**"This is all subjective"** (analysis paralysis)
- Response: "You're right, some is subjective. But we can validate with data. For now, let's capture what we believe to be true based on our experience."

**"We already know this"** (dismissiveness)
- Response: "Great. Then we should move quickly. Let's make sure we're all seeing the same picture."

---

## Opportunity Scoring

### The Scoring Formula

```
OPPORTUNITY SCORE = (Strength Match × 2) - Consideration Risk - Constraint Impact

Where:
- Strength Match: How well our strengths support this (1-5)
- Consideration Risk: How much considerations threaten this (1-5)
- Constraint Impact: How much constraints block this (1-5)

Score Range: -8 to +8
```

### Score Interpretation

| **Score** | **Interpretation** | **Recommendation** |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 7-10 | **High-confidence opportunity** | Prioritize, pursue soon |
| 4-6 | **Moderate opportunity** | Pursue with risk mitigation |
| 1-3 | **Marginal opportunity** | Requires significant changes first |
| 0 or below | **Low-viability opportunity** | Defer or decline |

### Scoring Examples

#### Example 1: "Launch AI-powered customer support tool"

**Strength Match (4/5)**:
- ✓ Strong technical team
- ✓ Existing customer base to test with
- ✓ Brand known for innovation
- ✗ Limited AI experience (reduces from 5 to 4)

**Consideration Risk (2/5)**:
- Low risk: Competitors not yet offering this
- Medium: Customer willingness to adopt AI uncertain

**Constraint Impact (3/5)**:
- Medium: Budget available but limited
- Medium: Would require hiring AI specialists
- Low: Tech infrastructure can support

**Score**: (4 × 2) - 2 - 3 = **3** (Marginal - proceed cautiously, address constraints first)

#### Example 2: "Expand into existing adjacent market"

**Strength Match (5/5)**:
- ✓ Product already solves this market's needs
- ✓ Sales team has relationships in adjacent space
- ✓ Brand recognition exists

**Consideration Risk (3/5)**:
- Medium: Some competitive presence
- Medium: Regulatory differences exist

**Constraint Impact (1/5)**:
- Low: Minimal additional resources needed
- Low: Sales team has capacity

**Score**: (5 × 2) - 3 - 1 = **6** (Moderate-to-High - strong candidate for H1/H2)

### Scoring Workshop Process

1. **Select opportunities to score** (usually top 10-15)
2. **Individual scoring** (5 minutes per opportunity)
3. **Share scores** (calculate average)
4. **Discuss outliers** (Why did some score high/low?)
5. **Adjust and finalize** (consensus scores)
6. **Rank by score** (creates prioritized list)

## Strategic Tensions

### What Are Strategic Tensions?

**Strategic tensions** are competing goods or conflicting priorities that require deliberate choices.

They're not problems to solve - they're **tensions to manage**.

### Common Strategic Tensions

#### 1. Growth vs. Profitability
- **Tension**: Invest in growth or optimize for profit?
- **Not**: Do both equally (impossible)
- **Choice**: What's the right balance for our stage?

#### 2. Innovation vs. Execution
- **Tension**: Explore new ideas or deliver on commitments?
- **Not**: Do both perfectly (spreads too thin)
- **Choice**: What ratio makes sense now?

#### 3. Speed vs. Quality
- **Tension**: Ship fast and iterate or perfect before launch?
- **Not**: Fast AND perfect (rarely possible)
- **Choice**: Where on spectrum for this initiative?

#### 4. Customer Breadth vs. Depth
- **Tension**: Serve many customer types or specialize?
- **Not**: Be all things to all people
- **Choice**: Who do we serve exceptionally well?

#### 5. Centralization vs. Autonomy
- **Tension**: Central control or local empowerment?
- **Not**: Both everywhere (creates confusion)
- **Choice**: What decisions stay central, what's distributed?

### How to Surface Tensions

**Questions to ask:**
- Where do we feel pulled in opposite directions?
- What trade-offs keep coming up?
- Where do different leaders disagree on priorities?
- What choices make us uncomfortable?

**Exercise: Tension Mapping**

```
Opportunity: "Expand product line"

Tension A: Breadth vs. Depth
├─ Left: Focus on 1-2 products (deep)
└─ Right: Launch many products (broad)

Tension B: Speed vs. Quality
├─ Left: Launch quickly, iterate (speed)
└─ Right: Perfect before launch (quality)

Where are we now? Where should we be?
    ←─────┼─────→
         Current    Target
```

### Why Name Tensions Explicitly

1. **Normalizes difficulty**: "This is supposed to be hard"
2. **Prevents false consensus**: Different people have different defaults
3. **Enables smart trade-offs**: Conscious choices, not accidents
4. **Creates space for experimentation**: We can try different positions

---

## Stakeholder Landscape

### Why Map Stakeholders?

Strategy doesn't exist in vacuum - it affects and is affected by stakeholders.

**Stakeholder landscape** maps:
- Who matters to our success?
- What do they need/want?
- How much influence do they have?
- How aligned are they with our direction?

### Stakeholder Categories

#### Internal Stakeholders
- Leadership team
- Board of directors
- Employees (by function/level)
- Internal partners (shared services, etc.)

#### External Stakeholders
- Customers (by segment)
- Partners and suppliers
- Investors/shareholders
- Regulators
- Community
- Competitors (yes, they matter)

### Stakeholder Mapping Process

#### Step 1: Identify Stakeholders

**Prompt**: "Who has a stake in our success or failure?"

Create comprehensive list (aim for 15-25 stakeholder groups).

#### Step 2: Map by Influence and Interest

```
                    High Interest
                         │
        Keep Satisfied   │   Key Players
                         │
    ─────────────────────┼─────────────────────
                         │
           Monitor       │   Keep Informed
                         │
                    Low Interest
        
        Low Influence ←──┼──→ High Influence
```

**Quadrants:**
- **Key Players**: High interest, high influence → Engage closely
- **Keep Satisfied**: Low interest, high influence → Don't alienate
- **Keep Informed**: High interest, low influence → Communicate regularly
- **Monitor**: Low interest, low influence → Minimal effort

#### Step 3: Understand Needs

For each key stakeholder group:
- **What do they need from us?**
- **What do they value most?**
- **What are their concerns?**
- **How aligned are they?**

#### Step 4: Identify Actions

What do we need to do to:
- Build support from key players?
- Address concerns?
- Maintain important relationships?
- Prevent blockers?

### Stakeholder Analysis Template

```
STAKEHOLDER: [Name/Group]

Interest Level: ⬜ Low  ⬜ Medium  ⬜ High
Influence Level: ⬜ Low  ⬜ Medium  ⬜ High

Key Needs:
- [What they need from us]

Current Alignment: ⬜ Opposed  ⬜ Neutral  ⬜ Supportive

Concerns/Objections:
- [What worries them]

Actions Required:
- [What we need to do]
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: "Analysis Paralysis"

**What it looks like**:
- Wanting more data before deciding
- Endless debate about details
- Delaying strategy work to "finish" context

**Why it happens**:
- Fear of being wrong
- Perfectionism
- Avoiding hard choices

**Solution**:
- Timeboxing: "We have 2 weeks, then we move forward"
- Good enough: "80% confidence is sufficient"
- Provisional: "We'll validate as we execute"

### Pitfall 2: "Toxic Positivity"

**What it looks like**:
- Everything is a strength
- No real constraints acknowledged
- Dismissing concerns as "negativity"

**Why it happens**:
- Culture that punishes truth-telling
- Leadership that doesn't want bad news
- Fear of being seen as negative

**Solution**:
- Frame it as "obstacles to remove"
- Show examples: "Great organizations acknowledge constraints"
- Anonymous input channels

### Pitfall 3: "Learned Helplessness"

**What it looks like**:
- Everything is a constraint
- No opportunities visible
- "We've tried everything"

**Why it happens**:
- History of failed initiatives
- Burnout and exhaustion
- Loss of agency

**Solution**:
- Start with strengths: "What IS working?"
- Small wins: "What could we do in next 30 days?"
- External perspective: Bring in outside facilitator

### Pitfall 4: "The Usual Suspects"

**What it looks like**:
- Same context from last year
- No new insights
- Recycled analysis

**Why it happens**:
- Going through motions
- No new information gathered
- Didn't involve diverse perspectives

**Solution**:
- Fresh voices: Include people new to organization
- Customer input: What are customers actually saying?
- Data: What does data show that surprises us?

### Pitfall 5: "Context as Checkbox"

**What it looks like**:
- Rushing through context to get to "real work"
- Perfunctory SWOT slide
- Moving to strategy without synthesis

**Why it happens**:
- Undervaluing context phase
- Pressure to show progress
- Impatience with groundwork

**Solution**:
- Show value: "This saved us 3 months of wasted effort last time"
- Make it engaging: Use interactive workshops, not slide reviews
- Explicit output: Context document that guides all future decisions
